## Instructions

1. Install Conda/miniconda
2. run ``conda env create -f environment.yml`` on a OSX (Apple Mac) device to create conda environment called ``folktables``. Unfortunately, the OSX and Linux packages in conda differ, so if you want to run this code on Linux, you will have to manually install the packages (fortunately, this does not take long).
3. Run ``folktables_experiment.ipynb`` or ``synthetic_experiment.ipynb`` using the newly installed ``folktables`` conda environment.
